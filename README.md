# Credit Card Fraud Detection System


## Project Overview

With the rapid increase in online transactions, credit card fraud has escalated into a major concern, resulting in billions of dollars in losses each year, impacting both businesses and consumers. To combat this, implementing effective fraud detection mechanisms is essential to prevent financial setbacks and protect users from unauthorized activities.

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning methodologies to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing large volumes of transaction data, the system can pinpoint fraud patterns, facilitating early intervention and reducing the risk of financial harm. The goal is to create a robust fraud detection system that strengthens the integrity of financial systems and builds consumer confidence.

What sets this project apart is its comprehensive approach to feature selection and model fine-tuning. The dataset used contains 120 features, and through an in-depth analysis, we pinpointed the most relevant ones to ensure efficient processing while minimizing irrelevant data. In contrast to typical solutions, this project explores multiple machine learning algorithms, comparing their effectiveness in detecting fraud. Through advanced hyperparameter optimization, we achieved a substantial increase in model accuracy, improving from 88.26% to 98.37%. This improvement is critical, as even small errors in fraud detection can result in significant financial losses and diminish trust in the system. This project demonstrates the value of applying a methodical, data-driven approach to address pressing real-world issues like credit card fraud.

## Problem Statement

Due to the increase in e-commerce and online transactions, credit card fraud has surged. Traditional fraud detection methods struggle to keep pace with the growing volume and evolving tactics of fraudsters. There is a
critical need for more advanced and efficient fraud detection mechanisms that can reduce financial losses for both financial institutions and consumers.
